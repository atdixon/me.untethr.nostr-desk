# me.untethr.nostr-desk


* work-in-progress
  - i.e., don't file bugs yet (or do if you like)
  - enjoy the ugly
  - wanna help?
* can't follow peeps yet so you'll have to create your identity and
  build your graph on another client
* db schema is subject to change rapidly
  - so MAY NEED TO do this whenever you pull new commits:
    - `$ rm ~/.nostr-desk`

Pre-requisites:

```
$ brew install clojure/tools/clojure
```

May need to install some java/jdk, say v. 17, if you don't have one

How to run:

```
$ make run
```

### MacOs Darwin arm64 build

To build the secp256k1 native lib, which is not currently available in central repos,
recursive clone https://github.com/ACINQ/secp256k1-kmp and run

```
$ TARGET=darwin ./native/build.sh
$ TARGET=darwin ./jni/jvm/build.sh
```

This will create a dylib file which you can patch into a jar in the local maven repo, for example:

```
$ mkdir -p ./fr/acinq/secp256k1/jni/native/darwin-aarch64
$ cp ./jni/jvm/build/darwin/libsecp256k1-jni.dylib fr/acinq/secp256k1/jni/native/darwin-aarch64
$ jar uf ~/.m2/repository/fr/acinq/secp256k1/secp256k1-kmp-jni-jvm-darwin/0.7.1/secp256k1-kmp-jni-jvm-darwin-0.7.1.jar fr
```
